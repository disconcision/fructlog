This is a mini-series of six entries which together introduce using quotation and pattern matching to represent and transform syntax in Racket. The focus is on quasiquotation; part 6 will assume you have a vague grasp of what pattern matching is, although I might fill in this gap later through a tutorial on implementing pattern matching.
